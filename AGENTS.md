# TransMax — Agent instructions

This file is the AGENTS.md convention used by Cursor, OpenAI Codex, and other autonomous coding agents. The content mirrors `CLAUDE.md`; refer to that file as the single source of truth.

If your agent reads `AGENTS.md` but not `CLAUDE.md`, the binding content is below.

## Tier 0 — Entropy

> Every change either fights entropy or feeds it. Default is feeding. Choose.

Before every commit: *am I leaving a broken window?* If yes, fix it now or open an explicit ticket.

For TransMax, "entropy" is the gap between what the code claims (audit chains, regulatory profiles, quality gates) and what survives a pharma CSV review. Closing that gap is v3.0.

## Tier 1 — Always-on principles

Full skill at `.claude/skills/design-philosophy/SKILL.md`. Condensed:

**Design:** deep modules · information hiding · pull complexity downward · define errors out · different layer different abstraction.
**Process:** don't live with broken windows · tracer bullets · reversibility · crash early · DRY · good enough.
**Discipline:** think before coding · simplicity first · surgical changes · goal-driven execution.
**Cross-cutting:** design twice · refactor mercilessly · design by contract · test ruthlessly · code is read 10× more than written.

## Tier 2 — Pre-commit self-review

Run the 22-item red-flag checklist in `design-philosophy/SKILL.md` before every commit.

## Mechanical gates

`kp-sdlc` quality-gate + transmax ratchet run at PreToolUse, pre-commit, and CI. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full pipeline diagram.

## TransMax-specific addenda

The 10 addenda (A1–A10) live in `CLAUDE.md`. They are normative; both agent runtimes must apply them identically. In summary:

- **A1** Audit-by-default — every state change emits an audit event before side effects.
- **A2** Quality at gates, not in translate — deterministic gates catch defects, LLMs only translate.
- **A3** No silent fallbacks in regulated paths — fail loud; never substitute mocks for real data.
- **A4** Don't deepen the dual-model-layer divergence — `database.py` vs `translation.py`.
- **A5** Stable IDs end-to-end — `segment_id` / `doc_id` / `audit_event_id` are sources of truth.
- **A6** LLMs are qualified suppliers — every call records provider/model/version/prompt-version.
- **A7** One canonical IA: `/workspace/*` — don't add top-level routes.
- **A8** Pin every prompt to a version — versioned YAML registry.
- **A9** Soft-delete only — no `DELETE FROM`; tombstones preserve the chain.
- **A10** `.context/` is the program brain — read at session start, update at session end.

Read `CLAUDE.md` for the full text and the "known issues you must not silently work around" list.
